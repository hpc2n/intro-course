# Introduction to Kebnekaise and HPC2N (January 2024)

## Course description

We begin with a short introduction to Linux, which is what is used on HPC2N's compute clusters, and the vast majority of HPC clusters worldwide. 
This part is only meant for complete beginners to the Linux operating system, and can be omitted if you are proficient already. See the schedule here: https://www.hpc2n.umu.se/events/courses/2023/intro-fall .

We then continue with an introduction to HPC and HPC2N, then move on to a walkthrough of the Kebnekaise system, including the GPUs.
After this, we go through the module system and take a brief look at how to submit jobs. During afternoon there will be hands-ons where you will get the opportunity to try loading modules, compile a program, and submit a job to the Kebnekaise cluster.

We will then look at some application examples, and how to run them at Kebnekaise. There will again be hands-ons for you to try this out yourself.
