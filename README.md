# Introduction to HPC and Kebnekaise (spring 2021)

## Course description

We begin with a short introduction to Linux, which is what is used on HPC2N's compute clusters, and the vast majority of HPC clusters on the planet. This part is only meant for complete beginners to the Linux operating system, and can be omitted if you are proficient already. See the schedule.

We then continue with an introduction to HPC and HPC2N, then move on to a walkthrough of the Kebnekaise system, including the GPUs and KNLs. In the afternoon we go through the module system and take a brief look at how to submit jobs. During the hands-on you will get the opportunity to try loading modules, compile a program, and submit a job to the Kebnekaise cluster.
