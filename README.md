This course begins with an introduction to HPC and HPC2N, then move on to a walkthrough of the Kebnekaise system, including the GPUs. We will go into some detail about the newest hardware as well as the Desktop onDemand way of logging in. 

After this, we go through the module system and take a brief look at how to submit jobs from the command line. We will also look at how to run interactive Jupyter/VSCode/MATLAB/RStudio/etc. jobs on the compute nodes. During the afternoon, there will be hands-ons where you will get the opportunity to try loading modules, compile a program, and submit a job to the Kebnekaise cluster, as well as try out the Desktop OnDemand.

We will then look at some application examples, and how to run them at Kebnekaise. There will again be hands-ons for you to try this out yourself.
