# Introduction to HPC2N and Kebnekaise - September 2024

## Course description

**NOTE**: if you need an introduction to Linux, we recommend signing up for the course "Introduction to Linux" which will be given just before this course, 16 September, 9:00-11:00. You can find the course page and registration here: https://www.hpc2n.umu.se/events/courses/2024/fall/intro-linux 

This course begins with an introduction to HPC and HPC2N, then move on to a walkthrough of the Kebnekaise system, including the GPUs. We will go into some detail about the new hardware. 

After this, we go through the module system and take a brief look at how to submit jobs. During the afternoon, there will be hands-ons where you will get the opportunity to try loading modules, compile a program, and submit a job to the Kebnekaise cluster.

We will then look at some application examples, and how to run them at Kebnekaise. There will again be hands-ons for you to try this out yourself.
