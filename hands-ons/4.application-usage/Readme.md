# Examples for the course "Introduction to HPC and Kebnekaise" 

We begin with a short introduction to Linux, which is what is 
used on HPC2N's compute clusters, and the vast majority of HPC 
clusters on the planet. This part is only meant for complete 
beginners to the Linux operating system, and can be omitted 
if you are proficient already. See the schedule.

We then continue with an introduction to HPC and HPC2N, then 
move on to a walkthrough of the Kebnekaise system, including 
the GPUs and KNLs. In the afternoon we go through the module 
system and take a brief look at how to submit jobs. During 
the hands-on you will get the opportunity to try loading 
modules, compile a program, and submit a job to the Kebnekaise 
cluster.

Remote/online participation: The course will be streamed. We 
will use Zoom. More information about connecting and such will 
be sent to the participants close to the course.
