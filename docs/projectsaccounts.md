# Projects - compute and storage

!!! Note 

    In order to have an account at HPC2N, you need to be a member of a **project**. 

    You can either join a project or apply for one yourself (if you fulfill the requirements). 

Previously, there were both storage projects and compute projects. The compute and storage projects have now been merged and there is only one type of project. 

The default amount of storage included with a project is 500GB. If this is not enough, you ask for more during the proposal. 

!!! Warning "Kebnekaise is only open for local project requests!" 

    - The PI must be affiliated with UmU, LTU, IRF, MiUN, or SLU.
    - You can still add members (join) from anywhere.

## Application process  

Apply for **projects** in [SUPR](https://supr.naiss.se/round/). 

- Login to SUPR (create a SUPR account if you do not have one).
- Click “Rounds” in the left menu. Pick “Local and Special Rounds”.
- Pick “HPC2N” and "HPC2N Local 2026". This is the direct link: [HPC2N Local](https://supr.naiss.se/round/hpc2n/)
- Choose “Create New Proposal for HPC2N Local Compute YYYY”.
- Create from scratch or use earlier proposal as starting point (Clone proposal).
- Agree to the default storage if 500GB is enough. Otherwise apply for more on the proposal.
- There are three "resources": Kebnekaise (CPUs), Kebnekaise GPUs (GPUs), and Kebnekaise Large Memory (large memory nodes). 
- More information: [https://supr.naiss.se/round/local/](https://supr.naiss.se/round/local/) 

!!! Note "Info"

    - As default, you have 25GB in your home directory.
    - If you need more, you/your PI can accept the "default storage" you will be offered after applying for compute resources.
    - The default storage is 500GB.
    - If you need more than that, you/your PI will have to apply for it in the proposal. 

After applying on SUPR, the project(s) will be reviewed.

<!-- ### Linking a compute project to a storage project

1. Before linking (SUPR): 

![to-link](images/to-link.png){: style="width: 90%;"}
<br><br style="clear: both;">
2. Pick a compute project to link:

![choose](images/choose2.png){: style="width: 90%;"} 
<br style="clear: both;">
3. Showing linked projects:

![linked](images/linked.png){: style="width: 90%;"}
<br><br style="clear: both;">
4. Members of the storage project after linking:

![storage-members](images/storage-members.png){: style="width: 90%;"}

## Accounts 

When you have a project / have become member of a project, you can apply for an account at HPC2N. This is done in SUPR, under "Accounts": [https://supr.naiss.se/account/](https://supr.naiss.se/account/). 

Your account request will be processed within a week. You will then get an email with information about logging in and links to getting started information. 

More information on the account process can be found on HPC2N's documentation pages: <a href="https://docs.hpc2n.umu.se/documentation/accounts-rules/" target="_blank">https://docs.hpc2n.umu.se/documentation/accounts-rules/</a>.
